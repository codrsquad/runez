tox_ is used for building and testing, ``setup.py`` is kept simple thanks to setupmeta_.

Development
===========

To get going locally, simply do this::

    git clone https://github.com/codrsquad/runez.git  # or your own fork
    cd runez

    python3 -mvenv .venv
    .venv/bin/pip install -r tests/requirements.txt -e .

    # You have a venv now in ./.venv, use it, open it with pycharm etc
    .venv/bin/python -mrunez colors

    source .venv/bin/activate
    which python

    python
    >>> import runez
    >>> runez.which("python")

    deactivate


Running the tests
=================

To run the tests, simply run ``tox``, this will run tests against all python versions you have locally installed.
You can use pyenv_ for example to get python installations.

Run:

* ``tox -e py39`` (for example) to limit test run to only one python version.

* ``tox -e style`` to run style checks only

* etc


Test coverage
=============

Run ``tox``, then ``open .tox/test-reports/htmlcov/index.html``
