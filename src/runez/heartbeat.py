"""
Daemon thread that can be used to run periodical background tasks.

Assumptions:
- Tasks should be reasonably short running (do not use this for long operations)
- Execution frequency should be >= 1 second (this is not designed for very quick frequency)
- Frequency does not dynamically change (stated once at task creation time)
- Tasks should complete within one frequency period (otherwise it'd be continuously called...)

Usage:
    from runez.heartbeat import Heartbeat

    Heartbeat.add_task(report_metrics, frequency=60)
    Heartbeat.add_task(check_something, frequency=30)
    Heartbeat.start()
    ...
    Heartbeat.stop()        # When shutting down
